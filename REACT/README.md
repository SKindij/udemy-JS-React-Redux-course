# REACT [official documentation](https://uk.reactjs.org/)

_It doesn't matter how I get to your house, what matters is which car I arrive in. It will either have an imperative manual transmission or a declarative automatic transmission. Enough metaphors? A car with an automatic transmission has a certain layer of abstraction over gear shifting._
> * Imperative: C, C++, Java.
> * Declarative: SQL, HTML.
> * Mixed (can be): JavaScript, C#, Python.

The W3C is currently working on a new **Shadow DOM standard** (_specification that describes a method for combining multiple DOM trees into a single hierarchy, and how these trees interact with each other within a document to better compose the DOM_).

Another option is to use the **Virtual DOM** approach (_instead of interacting with the DOM directly, we work with a lightweight copy of it. We can make changes to the copy based on our needs, and then apply the changes to the real DOM._).

**React JS** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces that popularized the idea of using a virtual DOM. React creates a lightweight tree from JavaScript objects to mimic a DOM tree. It then creates HTML from them, which is inserted or added to the desired DOM element, which causes the browser to redraw the page.
React is a library, not a framework, so comparing it to Angular or Ember is incorrect.
